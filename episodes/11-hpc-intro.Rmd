::: questions
 - "Why would I be interested in High Performance Computing (HPC)?"
 - "What can I expect to learn from this course?"
:::

::: objectives
 - "Be able to describe what an HPC system is"
 - "Identify how an HPC system could benefit you."
:::

::: keypoints
 - "High Performance Computing (HPC) typically involves connecting to very large
  computing systems elsewhere in the world."
 - "These other systems can be used to do work that would either be impossible
  or much slower on smaller systems."
 - "The standard method of interacting with such systems is via a command line
  interface called Bash."
